                Users can navigate around Stack overflow using the navigation bar at the top of each page on the website. 
                This bar has links to all the major pages on the site and provides a few other fundamental services to users such as logging in.
                <br><br>
                There is a footer page every single page. Footers would have been an excellent way to provide users with easy access to some of the more hard to access information 
                about the page - such as the help section which is only accessible through a subheading in the more menu. 
                Footers would have made it more easy to access certain information on the website.

        <h3>Mobile Navigation</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <figure id="figImageMobileCenterNav">
                <img id="imgMobileCenterNav" src="img/MobileCenterNav.PNG" alt="MobileCenterNav">
                <figcaption class="figure">Figure 3. Center navigation bar.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As screens of mobile devices are generally smaller than computers the navigation bar present on the desktop website has been compressed down so that 
                it only contains six elements. 
                <br><br>
                The Stack overflow Logo (still links to the home page), the menu link (which when clicked reveals a drop down menu to all pages on the website) and the login link. 
                The mobile navigation system feels intuitive. 
                When accessed with my phone all the links lead to the correct pages which made it much easier to navigate around the website 
                and their was a clearly labelled link to access the homepage which made it far more obvious how to access the page.
