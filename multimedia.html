            <p>
                I used the Chrome inspect to determine the format of the images Stack overflow used on their website. 
                <br><br>
                Images can come in two main forms; raster images or vector images. 
                Raster images are usually more detailed and are larger files while vector images are generally less detailed and can be scalable. 
                This means that a vector image can change size to fit to a screen. (Unitec MMWD PPT Image)
                <br><br>
                Stack overflow's images are Compressed Scalable Vector Graphics Images (.svgz). 
                This was a good design choice as vector images are quite simple and using a more complex raster image may have created an unnessecarily large image file 
                which would have slowed down the loading time of the page.
                <br><br>
                Stack overflow also shows good design in where it has used images. 
                The images on the blog tell users about what is happening in the corresponding articles 
                - they are not there just as eye candy. 
                This is a good design choice as 'Images that are included in a web page for the sole purpose of filling white space donâ€™t help anyone' Wright, J, (2015).
